    "### Minimum Height Trees\n",
    "given an undirected graph that has characteristics of a k-ary tree. In such a graph, we can choose any node as the root to make a k-ary tree. The root (or the tree) with the minimum height will be called Minimum Height Tree (MHT). There can be multiple MHTs for a graph. In this problem, we need to find all those roots which give us MHTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since leaves can’t give us MHT, we can remove them from the graph and remove their edges too. \n",
    "- Once we remove the leaves, we will have new leaves. Repeat the process and remove them from the graph too.\n",
    "- We will prune the leaves until we are left with one or two nodes which will be our answer and the roots for MHTs.\n",
